    abstract = "This paper presents a research thesis proposal to develop a generalizable Native American language identification system. Despite their cultural and historical significance, Native American languages remain entirely unsupported by major commercial language identification systems. This omission not only underscores the systemic neglect of endangered languages in technological development, but also highlights the urgent need for dedicated, community-driven solutions. We propose a two-pronged approach: (1) systematically curating linguistic resources across all Native American languages for robust training, and (2) tailored data augmentation to generate synthetic yet linguistically coherent training samples. As proof of concept, we extend an existing rudimentary Athabaskan language classifier by integrating Plains Apache, an extinct Southern Athabaskan language, as an additional language class. We also adapt a data generation framework for low-resource languages to create synthetic Plains Apache data, highlighting the potential of data augmentation. This proposal advocates for a community-driven, technological approach to supporting Native American languages.",

  abstract = {The mammalian genome organizes into complex three-dimensional structures, where interactions among chromatin regulatory elements play a pivotal role in mediating biological functions, highlighting the significance of genomic region interactions in biological research. Traditional biological sequencing techniques like HiC and MicroC, commonly employed to estimate these interactions, are resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially given the vast array of cell lines and tissues involved. With the advent of advanced machine learning (ML) methodologies, there has been a push towards developing ML models to predict genomic interactions. However, while these models excel in predicting interactions for cell lines similar to their training data, they often fail to generalize across distantly related cell lines or accurately predict interactions specific to certain cell lines. Identifying the potential oversight of excluding example genomic region interaction information from model inputs as a fundamental limitation, this paper introduces GRACHIP, a model rooted in graph neural network technology aiming to address this issue by incorporating detailed interaction information as a hint. Through extensive testing across various cell lines, GRACHIP not only demonstrates exceptional accuracy in predicting chromatin interaction intensity but showcases remarkable generalizability to cell lines not encountered during training. Consequently, GRACHIP emerges as a potent research tool, offering a viable alternative to conventional sequencing methods for analyzing the interactions and three-dimensional organization of mammalian genomes, thus alleviating the dependency on expensive and time-consuming biological sequencing techniques. It also offers an alternative way for researchers to investigate 3D chromatin interactions and simulate their changes in model systems to test their hypotheses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
