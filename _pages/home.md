### About me

I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Oakland University, beginning in August 2025. Prior to this, I completed a one-year postdoctoral appointment at Georgia Tech and currently hold a visiting scholar position at Dartmouth College. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Dartmouth, where I was advised by Prof. Soroush Vosoughi. I also hold an M.S. in Computer Science from New York University and a B.E. in Computer Science from the Communication University of China. My academic background spans diverse institutional and cultural contexts, which has shaped both the scope and the social awareness of my research.

My research interests lie at the intersection of natural language processing and responsible artificial intelligence. I focus on developing methodologies that improve the transparency, reliability, and societal alignment of large language models, with particular attention to challenges such as bias, hallucination, and interpretability. In addition to core NLP problems, I am also interested in applying AI to interdisciplinary domains, including computational social science and biological research. I am actively building a research group dedicated to advancing robust, ethical, and scientifically grounded AI.
